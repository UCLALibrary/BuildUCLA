## What is BuildUCLA?

BuildUCLA is a software development incubator based in the UCLA Library. It brings together students and team leaders from the library to build tech-oriented projects that will benefit library users and the entire UCLA community

* Where to study: extending the dining halls’ wifi-based “how crowded is it now?” service to the campus libraries
* Consolidated Android/iOS library smartphone apps
* Community Cataloging (CCing): combining crowdsourcing tech + optical character recognition + auto-translation to help the library catalog foreign-language books
* Working with UCLA digital library collections of historical photographs, news videos, maps, sound recordings and texts:
* Building creative exploratory visualizations
* Generating data mashups with external sources
* Training machine-learning models for enhanced search and discovery
