## What is BuildUCLA?

BuildUCLA is a software development incubator based in the UCLA Library. It brings together tech-savvy students from across campus and team leaders from the library to build projects that will benefit library users and the entire UCLA community.

## Projects
### Projects we want to do this year & the skills needed -- on-the-job learning is encouraged:

1. Where to study: extending the dining halls’ wifi-based “how crowded is it now?” service to the campus libraries
1. Consolidated Android/iOS library smartphone apps
1. <a href="http://ec2-54-173-153-28.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/#/">Community Cataloging (CCing)</a>: combining crowdsourcing tech + optical character recognition + auto-translation to help the library catalog foreign-language books
1. Working with UCLA digital library collections of historical photographs, news videos, maps, sound recordings and texts:
    * Building creative exploratory visualizations
    * Generating data mashups with external sources
    * Training machine-learning models for enhanced search and discovery

### Past projects:

* Android and iOS mobile apps for the library
* Stashd (a citation/link storage service)
* eLab-X -- integrated Google Drive/Dropbox/Box storage for research data, electronic lab notebooks


### Who can join?
* Current undergraduate students in CS, EE or in related fields are encouraged to apply. So are students in other departments with some coding experience. Participants typically work up to 20 hours per week as library student employees.
* In the past, current graduate students also have been involved with specific experimental projects on a part-time or volunteer basis.
